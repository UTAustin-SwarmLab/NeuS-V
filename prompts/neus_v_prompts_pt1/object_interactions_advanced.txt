2. "A robot assembling components until it completes a cycle, and then it pauses momentarily before starting again."
3. "Always an electric kettle boiling water, until steam begins to escape, and then it automatically shuts off."
4. "A lightbulb flickering intermittently, until the switch is turned off, and then the room is cast into darkness."
5. "Always a wind turbine spinning in the breeze, until the wind dies down, and then its blades come to a gradual stop."
