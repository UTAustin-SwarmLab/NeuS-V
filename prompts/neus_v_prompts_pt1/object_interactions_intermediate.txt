5. "Always a computer monitor displaying a screensaver, and a mouse stationary on the pad."
6. "A fan blowing steadily until it's turned off, and then the room falls silent."
7. "Always a microwave heating up dinner, and the timer counting down the minutes."
8. "A drone hovering in the air until it reaches its next waypoint, and then it continues to fly."
9. "Always a sewing machine humming as fabric moves through it, and spools of thread unraveling."
10. "A toaster heating bread until it pops, and then butter melting on the warm toast."
11. "Always a clock ticking on the mantle, and a fireplace crackling beneath."
12. "A coffee maker brewing until the carafe is full, and the aroma filling the kitchen."
13. "Always a vending machine dispensing drinks, and people retrieving their purchase from the slot."
14. "A car battery charging until it's full, and then the charger light turns green."
15. "Always a laser printer producing documents, and stacks of paper accumulating beside it."
