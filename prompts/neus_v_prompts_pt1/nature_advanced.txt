1. "Always a river flowing quietly through the valley, until the sky darkens with storm clouds, and rain begins to pour heavily."
2. "Always the sun rising over the mountains, until snow begins to fall, and the landscape turns white."
3. "The ocean waves gently lapping at the shore, until a storm bursts in, and then lightning flashes across the sky."
4. "Always the wind whispering through the pine trees, until dusk falls, and the forest is illuminated by a full moon."
5. "Always flowers swaying in the gentle breeze, until clouds roll in, and a soft rain nourishes the earth."
